## 3. Croatia Visa Research (COMPLETED)

### Can a Schengen visa allow an Indian passport holder to go to Croatia?
**YES.** Croatia joined the Schengen Area on **January 1, 2023**. A single Schengen Type C visa covers both Croatia and France (and all 29 Schengen countries). No separate Croatia visa is needed.

### Key Facts
- A US green card or US visa alone does **NOT** grant entry to Croatia — you need a Schengen visa
- One Schengen visa covers the entire trip (Croatia + France)
- The visa allows stays of up to **90 days within a 180-day period** across all Schengen states

### Trip Order Recommendation
Since you're spending 1 week in each country (equal duration), the embassy rule is based on **first port of entry**:
- **Option A (Recommended):** Fly to France first, then Croatia → Apply at **French embassy** (much easier process, TLScontact center in Seattle)
- **Option B:** Fly to Croatia first, then France → Apply at **Croatian embassy** in Washington DC (limited availability)
