**Goal:** (1) Remove previous owner from Coast Guard documentation, then (2) register the boat under my name with Washington State.

## Part 1: Delete Vessel from USCG Coast Guard Documentation

Since you are not a U.S. citizen, you cannot hold Coast Guard documentation in your name. The boat must be deleted from USCG documentation so it can be registered at the state level instead.

### Steps

- [ ] **Confirm no outstanding liens or mortgages** — The NVDC will not process a deletion if there are any encumbrances on the vessel. Check with the previous owner and request a lien search if needed.
- [ ] **Obtain the original Certificate of Documentation (COD)** — The previous owner must surrender the original COD as part of the deletion process. If it is lost, an Affidavit of Loss may be required.
- [ ] **Have the previous owner complete Form CG-4593** — This is the "Application, Consent, and Approval for Withdrawal of Vessel from Documentation." The previous owner (the person named on the COD) must sign this form requesting deletion.
  - Vessel name
  - Official documentation number
  - Reason for deletion (e.g., "sale to non-citizen; vessel to be state-registered")
  - Owner's name, address, and signature
  - Date of sale
- [ ] **Prepare the Bill of Sale** — Include the original or a copy of the bill of sale with the deletion request. This records the transfer of ownership with the NVDC.
- [ ] **Mail the deletion package to the NVDC:**
  - Form CG-4593 (signed by previous owner)
  - Original Certificate of Documentation (COD)
  - Bill of Sale (original or copy)

  **Mail to:**
  > USCG / National Vessel Documentation Center
  > 792 T.J. Jackson Drive
  > Falling Waters, WV 25419

  **Phone:** (800) 799-8362 or (304) 271-2400
  **Fax:** (304) 271-2405
  **Email:** nvdc@uscg.mil

- [ ] **Wait for processing** — The NVDC typically processes deletion requests in 2-6 weeks, but demand can cause delays. Follow up by phone or email if needed.
- [ ] **Receive confirmation of deletion** — The NVDC will issue a letter confirming the vessel has been deleted from documentation. **Keep this letter — you will need it for Washington State registration.**

## Part 2: Register Boat with Washington State

Once the vessel is deleted from Coast Guard documentation, you can title and register it with the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

### Documents to Gather

- [ ] **Bill of Sale** — Your existing bill of sale proving you purchased the vessel.
- [ ] **NVDC Deletion Confirmation Letter** — Proof that the vessel is no longer federally documented.
- [ ] **Previous owner's Certificate of Documentation (or NVDC deletion letter as substitute)** — To establish chain of title.
- [ ] **Vessel Title Application** — Complete this form (available at any vehicle licensing office or online from WA DOL).
- [ ] **Vessel Data / Use Tax Form** — Required for calculating and paying use tax.

### Pay Sales / Use Tax

- [ ] **Determine if sales tax was already paid** — If you paid sales tax at the time of purchase, bring proof of payment.
- [ ] **If no sales tax was paid, pay Use Tax** — Since this is a private-party purchase, you almost certainly owe Washington use tax. The rate is:
  - **6.5% state sales tax** + local tax (varies by county where the boat will be moored/stored)
  - Total typically ranges from **7.7% to 10.5%** depending on your county
  - Use tax is calculated on the purchase price or fair market value, whichever is higher
- [ ] **Pay use tax** — You can either:
  - Pay at the vehicle licensing office when you register, OR
  - File a Consumer Use Tax Return with the WA Department of Revenue beforehand
- [ ] **Starting July 1, 2026:** Be aware of the new **0.5% luxury tax on watercraft** that applies in addition to sales/use tax

### Registration & Title Fees

- [ ] **Title application fee:** $18.00
- [ ] **Title filing fee:** $6.50
- [ ] **Title transfer service fee:** $18.00
- [ ] **Registration filing fee:** $6.50
- [ ] **Registration renewal service fee:** $15.00
- [ ] **Derelict vessel & invasive species removal fee:** $5.00
- [ ] **Annual derelict vessel removal surcharge:** $1.00
- [ ] **Watercraft excise tax:** 0.5% of vessel value (annual, collected at registration renewal)

**Estimated total (fees only, excluding taxes):** ~$70

### Register at a Licensing Office

- [ ] **Find your nearest vehicle & boat licensing office** — [WA DOL Office Locator](https://fortress.wa.gov/dol/dolprod/vehoffices/)
- [ ] **Bring all documents listed above** plus payment (check, money order, or card at some offices)
- [ ] **Receive your WN# registration number and decals** — Display these on the boat per the included instructions
- [ ] **Note: You must register within 15 days of purchase** (if bought in WA) or **60 days of moving to WA** (if new resident)
